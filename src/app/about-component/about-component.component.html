                    Hi, I'm Stephen. I am a web developer who has built a lot of doo dads using JavaScript, mostly with
                    React.
                    I've also built things using Node/Express and Postgres, and I've dabbled with Django. Some time ago,
                    I've used jQuery,
                    but I'm also fairly well versed in Vanilla JavaScript. This portfolio is the result of experimenting
                    with Angular and BulmaCSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided to learn how to code a few years ago because I always wanted to learn to
                    program the powerful machines that we can now hold in our palms.
                    I was always interested in technology and finally decided to take the dive. Before that,
                    I received a degree in social science from the City College of New York.
